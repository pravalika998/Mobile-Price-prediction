# Mobile-Price-prediction
This project is about predicting the price of a mobile phone by taking the inputs from users. This contains various inputs like battery capacity, internal memory, color, ram, etc.  So, by taking a given set of data I had made various algorithms which predict the price of a mobile phone. These are the following algorithms:
a) Logistic Regression
b) KNN Classification
c) Decision Tree Classification
d) Random Forest Classification
e) SVM Classifier with linear kernel.

All the algorithms go like this:
1)Remove and handle null values (if any).
2)Splitting data into training and test data.
3)Predict the price range for test data
4)Compute Confusion matrix and classification report for each of these models.

At last KNN Classification had a best accuracy of 90.
